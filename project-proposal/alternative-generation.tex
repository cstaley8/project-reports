\section{Master Control Unit}
\paragraph{Rasberry Pi} 
The \gls{pi} is a single board computer developed by the Rasberry Pi Foundation (RPF) to promote computer science education in schools worldwide. 
It is based off of the Broadcom BCM2835 System on a Chip (SOC) featuring a 700 MHz ARM processor, VideoCore IV GPU, and 512 MB of Random Access Memory (RAM). 
This enables the Pi to maintain a complete Linux Operating System (OS), at a price point just under 35 US Dollars (USD). 
Of major beniﬁt to the Pi is the community that has emerged to support its development post-launch.

\paragraph{BeagleBoard}
The BeagleBoard (BB) is a single board computer developed by Texas Instruments (TI) for the Digi-Key and Newark consumer markets. 
It is based off of the OMAP3530 SOC featuring a 600 MHz ARM processor, TMS320C64+ DSP, and 256 MB of RAM.
This enables the BeagleBoard to operate a variety of Linux OS’s, for a cost of 45 USD. 
Of major beniﬁt to the BB is its well documented and supported development cycle, as provided by TI.

\paragraph{Arduino Mega} 
The Arduino platform is a grouping of microcontroller implementations that utilize the AVR \& ARM chip archtectures, in combination with a custom compiler. 
The most powerful device in this series is the Arduino Mega, with a 16 MHz clock speed has 128 KB of meory, and 54 digital GPIO pins. 
While not capable of running an entire OS, this microcontroller offers direct register access and is ethernet capable. 
The Arduino community is also one of the most active open source hardware communities alive on the web today.

\section{Motor Driver}
\paragraph{DRV8825} 
The DRV8825 is a microstepping bipolar stepper motor driver manufactured by TI. 
It features adjustable current limiting, overcurrent and overtemperature protection, and six microstep resolutions (down to 1/32-step). 
It operates from 8.2 45 V and can deliver up to approximately 1.5 A per phase without a heat sink or forced air ﬂow (rated for up to 2.2 A per coil with suffcient additional cooling).

\paragraph{A4988}
In the same vein as the DRV8825, the A4988 is a microstepping bipolar stepper motor driver manufactured by Allegro. 
The driver features adjustable current limiting, overcurrent and overtemperature protection, and ﬁve different microstep resolutions (down to 1/16-step). 
It oper- ates from 8 35 V and can deliver up to approximately 1 A per phase without a heat sink or forced air ﬂow (it is rated for 2 A per coil with suffcient additional cooling).

\paragraph{TB6560} 
The TB6560 is a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) chopper-type stepping motor driver IC designed for sinusoidal-input microstep control of bipolar stepping motors. 
The TB6560 can be used in applications that require 2-phase, 1-2-phase, 2W1-2-phase and 4W1-2-phase excitation modes. 
The TB6560 is capable of low-vibration, high-performance forward and reverse driving of a two-phase bipolar stepping motor using only a clock signal.
