\section{Objective Tree}
Figure ~\ref{fig:o-tree} outlines the requirements for having a functioning \gls{cnc} interface for this Senior Thesis Project.
Safety is the most important objective in this project since the \gls{cnc} interface will control moving components, although these moving components are outside the scope of this report.
Next most important is the \gls{cnc} functionality, otherwise the interface would not be able to control any \gls{cnc}.
Speed and accuracy is rated next most important to ensure the movements coordinated by the interface are as closed to the desired as possible.
The \gls{cnc} control is required to allow G-Code to be uploaded to the system and allow system monitoring.
A variable power input is desired so that users may purchase a power supply that fits their motors' needs, ensuring that a properly priced power supply is bought for the system.

\section{Success Criteria}
The project's success will be determined by whether or not the 10 engineering requirements, consisting of 5 \gls{pcsc} and 5 \gls{pssc}, are met. 

\subsection{Five Project Common Success Criteria}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Create a complete \gls{bom} and order/sample all parts needed for the design.
	\item Develop complete, accurate, readable schematic of the design, complete with interface loading analysis and interface timing analysis. 
	\item Complete a layout and etch a \gls{pcb}.
	\item Populate and debug the design on a custom \gls{pcb}.
	\item Professionally package the finished product and demonstrate its functionality.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Five Project Specific Success Criteria}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The system will drive at least 4 stepper motors, 1 DC motor, and 16 General Purpose Outputs.
The system will receive inputs from at least 1 emergency stop switch and 4 stepper motor home inputs.
	\item The system will Receive G-code through \gls{tcpip}.
The systemâ€™s software will be developed using IEEE Std 830-1998 Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications.
	\item The step frequency range will be at a minimum of 10kHz.
For any chosen frequency in range, the actual step frequency will be within 5\% of the desired frequency.
	\item The system power supply will accept between 14V and 36V and draw a maximum of 10A, including current required for the motors. 
	\item The system will stop all motors and shutdown all microcontrollers if the main microcontroller temperature reaches $60^{\circ}C$.
\end{enumerate}
