\chapter{Engineering Analysis}

Once design alternatives were evaluated and the anticipated project implementation specifics were chosen, the team set out to professionally implement the design.
This entails carefully designing each of the project's components, including the hardware design, software design, and packaging design.
Thorough design ensured that implementation issues were anticipated and therefore mitigated or avoided.
