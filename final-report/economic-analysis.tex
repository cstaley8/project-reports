\section{Economic Analysis}
The \gls{cnc} is one of few growing hardware based enterprises in the modern technology market.
In allowing manufacturers greater control over the production process, a wider variety of goods can be produced with limited machinery.
This in turn means that fewer capital resources are required in manufacturing, and production centers can be localized.
Consumers will benifit greatly from the "highly flexible, small-scale manufacturing"\cite{3dprintimpact} provided by the \gls{cnc}.

The \gls{ceenc} brings this technology to an even broader audience, in allowing consumers themselves to produce goods from raw materials.
Persons may circumvent the supply chain entirely, by uploading and milling custom objects on the device.\cite{3dprintsave}
For example, in past years obtaining a differential retainer clip for a 1987 Nissan Hardbody Pickup Truck may have involved a trip to the store, and an order from a centralized warehouse.
This measure could be circumvented entirely however, if the store were to provide \gls{cnc} services, and manufacture the item on the spot. 
Distribution can be made even simpler by making it a household device.

Procuring parts from washing machine load couplers to blender bases with the \gls{ceenc} is as simple as uploading a file.
This in turn increases the overal product lifespan.
While this project has been completed on strictly non-profit grounds, the economic implications for the technology as a whole is staggering.

\section{Manufacturability}
Component selection for the \gls{ceenc} was centered around ease of diagnosis, repair, and human assembly.
This in turn puts the system as it stands at a disadvantage for mass production, but inhibited the growth of 3214 gray hairs between its 4 designers.
Should the device go into production, components will be selected based on size, cost, and package. 
The DRV8825 breakout boards will be placed directly on the device, and as many through-hole components as possible will be replaced with surface mount equivalents.
The \gls{pi} will also be eliminated from the system, and the entire assembly placed on a single board.

While operational environment concerns were largely ignored for the prototyping of this device, its use in high dust conditions delegates the need for conformal coating on all surfaces.
Potting compound should also be applied to reduce damages incurred from excessive vibration.
Finally, the enclosure should be made to manage airflow in a manner that mitigates the migration of mites into the membrane of its heat sinks.
